<h1>Notes on an Introduction to Cryptography</h1>
<p>Most intro to cryptography start by presenting the caesar cipher, then how to break it using letter frequency, then most of the time the Vigenere cipher and a few more steps including the one-time pad
to go to a presentation of AES.
At least that's how I remember the beginning of my first course on crypto.
This is a (crude) reflexion on how I would make an introduction to cryptography for the kind of public we were as EURECOM students.</p>
<p>I think I would start by simple word subsitution
because that is the most intuitive form of secret code.
Good examples are Thieves'cant and the French <em>argot</em>.
This is what people do instinctively when they need to communicate in a hidden way:
they substitute words with other words.</p>
<p>I would do a first "analysis" of this form of code: what are its main drawbacks?
The main problem here I would say is the key size:
if you need a replacement for almost every english word,
this is too much to memorize or even to write down,
that's just not practical.
One of the consequences is that when your adversary gets to learn your code
it is incredibly difficult to change it because of the size of the secret.</p>
<p>It is then interesting to switch to letter substitution.
This is not going to work for verbal communication
because the encrypted message becomes unpronounceable,
but for written communications it should be okay.
Also you'll probably have to get rid of spaces and punctuation
until we start working with bytes, but that's okay too.
Now your secret is some permutation of the English alphabet,
and not a substitution of the entire english dictionary any more.</p>
<p>Let's evaluate the obtained encryption scheme.
Intuitively the result seems more or less as "secure" as word substitution,
with the secret being much smaller.
The caesar cipher is just a particular case of such fixed-substitution cipher
where we want a key that is even smaller:
we just "rotate" the alphabet and remember by how much we rotate it,
and this is typically done by remembering which letter the letter "a" is replaced by.</p>
<p>Now we can talk about letter frequency,
as you have it in every introduction to cryptography:
a same letter will always be substituted by the same other letter,
now in english text some letters are more frequent than others
so you can identify for instance the letter "e"
and deduce by how much the alphabet was rotated, and you recover the message.</p>
<p>So we just got where all introductions go:
breaking the caesar cipher with letter frequency.
But here caesar is simply presented as a special case of a fixed substitution.
I would describe the attack through letter frequency as an attack against any fixed substitution.
I think this is much more interesting because such substitutions
are very frequent in more modern cryptography (ECB mode, S-boxes...)
whereas caesar cipher will probably never be mentionned again.
It could be interesting to note that with the caesar cipher,
the key space is so small that
brute force is probably more interesting than letter frequency attack.</p>
<p>Then I would go immediately to one-time pad.
I don't know why but I am not that a fan of the usual part with Vigenère etc.
We would stay with letters,
and remark that letter frequency attacks
do not work that well on short messages.
The idea is then to change the key every such letters
so that we stay with small messages for each key.
If we put this logic to its end,
we end up picking a new letter for every letter of the message.
Then something really strange happens:
our scheme becomes surprisingly secure.
We can show that
obtaining the ciphertext gives you no information at all about what the message was.</p>
<p>I would spend some time insisting on what just happenned:
we just went from one of the worst encryption scheme (Caesar's cipher)
to something super-secure, and all it took was to change the key often enough.
This at least teaches us how small changes can have dramatic consequences in crypto.</p>
<p>Then, of course the mandatory step after introcuding the one-time-pad:
it's just not practical to have a key the size of the message,
and to be unable to re-use it.</p>
<p>But then I would instantaneously jump to the following note:
in most modern ciphers,
the only aim is to re-create the security of the one-time-pad
without this problem of a super-long key.
Namely what a stream cipher tries to do is to generate a stream of characters
(we still haven't switched to bits)
that is as long as the message and looks completely random,
but is actually generated with a short key.
This proximity between the oldest "secure" cipher (Vernam cipher/one-time pad)
and modern ciphers
is something that I think is lost when the first modern cipher you see is AES.
I have the impression that because stream ciphers at least as old as AES (typically RC4)
have been broken,
beginers are introduced to modern block ciphers before modern stream ciphers,
and I think that's a pitty because you lose this proximity with the Vernam cipher.
What's more, we have today an excellent stream cipher that is Chacha20,
which is being widely used and which paper is actually a quite simple read.</p>
<p>After I finish the manuscript of my PhD thesis, I have to try actually writing an intro to cryptography.</p>
